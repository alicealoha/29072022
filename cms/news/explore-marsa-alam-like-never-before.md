### Explore Marsa Alam like never before

Marsa Alam, a town located on the western shore of the Red Sea is known as a world-class scuba diving and kitesurfing destination. Marsa Alam transformed from being a small fishing village to a famous sea resort. Unlike more commercial cities like Sharm El Sheikh and Hurghada, the beauty of Marsa Alam is still untouched by the harmful effects of modernization.

Diving is one of the best activities to explore underwater life in the most magical way possible and the Red Sea is the best place for it. Combining the best of the north and south, Marsa Alam offers a diving experience that suits every kind of diver.

The world's finest all-around dive destinations include the famous Brothers Islands, Elphinstone and Daedulus, to the unique wreck of the Salem Express and seagrass beds of Egypt's central Red Sea. All of these you can see from the adventurous liveaboard voyage.

Shore diving in Marsa Alam is worth exploring, as it provides a great option for beginner divers with several large coral reefs located a little further. These include the Brothers Island, Elphinstone, and Daedalus. Brother Islands are only accessible by the liveaboard and are known as the most renowned sites for experienced divers featuring sharks, rays, and wrecks. Situated offshore, Daedalus is a truly astonishing marine park densely covered in soft corals and sea fans.
